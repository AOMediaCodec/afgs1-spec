## Scope

This document specifies: a film grain synthesis process, and a corresponding a binary 
format for representing and transmitting its parameters. The binary format is intended 
to be transported in structures of (video) elementary streams that permit embedding 
data non-essential for decoding the elementary bitstreams, sometimes referred to 
as metadata or supplemental information. The document provides the syntax to 
carry this binary format in ITU-T T.35 messages. Alternatively, the payload 
can be carried by other suitable transport mechanisms.

This specification is based on the film grain modeling process that is specified 
in the AV1 specification. However, this specification allows sending more than one film grain parameter
set for a decoded picture. A decoder can apply the film grain synthesis process at a different
resolution than the decoded picture resolution if the parameters for such resolution 
are present in the bitstream. A film grain 
parameter set that corresponds to the decoded picture resolution has to be present, which
may be useful for certain AV1 film grain synthesis implementations.
