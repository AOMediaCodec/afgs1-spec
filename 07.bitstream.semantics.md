## Syntax structures semantics

### General

This section specifies the meaning of the syntax elements read in the syntax
structures.

Important variables and function calls are also described.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 metadata semantics

**itu_t_t35_country_code** is a syntax element that corresponds to the syntax element itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code in an ITU-T T.35 user registered metadata syntax. Its value shall be equal to 0xB5, which indicates that the
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code is registered in the United States.

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code** are two bytes having values specified as a terminal
provider code in
[reference name required](https://cdn.cta.tech/cta/media/media/resources/standards/pdfs/manucode_2020-2.pdf).
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code equal to 0x5890 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload is
specified by AOMedia.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 payload semantics

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code** provides the value of the
ITU-T T.35 terminal provider oriented code that is defined
in the [AOMedia metadata registry](https://aomediacodec.github.io/metadata-registry/) specification.
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code equal to 0x0001 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload
contains AOMedia film grain parameters, as defined by this specification.

### Film grain parameter sets semantics

**num_film_grain_sets_minus1** plus 1 specifies the number of signaled film grain parameter sets.

 **select_film_grain_param_set()** is a function that returns the index of the film grain parameter
 set signaled in the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function that is most appropriate for the current
 decoder configuration.

**Note:** It is recommended that the most appropriate film grain parameter set is the film grain
parameter set having the largest spatial resolution that is both supported by the film grain synthesis
process of the decoder and is less than or equal to the intended display resolution.
{:.alert .alert-info }

#### Conformance

Conformance to this specification requires that all requirements specified in this section be fulfilled.

For a given decoded picture, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set for a given
combination of luma horizontal and luma vertical resolution.

For a given decoded picture, one film grain parameter set with apply_horz_resolution and
apply_vert_resolution respectively equal to (i) the horizontal resolution of the coded
frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2 and (ii) the vertical resolution of the coded
frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2 shall be provided.

Film grain parameter sets in a single ITU-T T.35 message shall not have the same combination
of luma horizontal and luma vertical resolutions.

Film grain parameter sets in a single ITU-T T.35 message shall not have the same
film_grain_param_set_idx value.

Each T.35 message shall contain one film grain parameter set with apply_horz_resolution and
apply_vert_resolution respectively equal to (i) the horizontal resolution of the coded
frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2 and (ii) the vertical resolution of the coded
frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2.

**Note:** The conformance statement above means that each T.35 message must include a
set of film grain parameters that correspond to the coded resolution.
[AN]: # (So, FGS parameter sets are sent in different SEI messages, each SEI message should
still have decoded picture resolution?)
{:.alert .alert-info }


### Film grain parameters semantics

This metadata provides the post-processing module with a model for parameterized film grain
synthesis. The film grain process is applied to frames output by a video decoder or
a video post-processing module. The film grain synthesis shall be applied at the decoder output resolution.

**Note:** An encoder may use this film grain metadata to characterize film grain that was present in the
original source video material and was removed by pre-processing filtering techniques. The specified
film grain parameters and the post-processing algorithm are equivalent to the AV1 film grain synthesis
at the frame level.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The film grain parameters signaled in this metadata message are applied to the output video frame that
is associated with the coded video frame that follows the current metadata message in the
encoded video bitstream. 

**Note:** When coding the film grain parameters in this metadata message, the encoder should consider the 
scalability layers structure of the bitstream. In particular, the metadata assosiated with lower scalability layers
should not refer to the film grain parameters associated with higher scalability layers.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**Note:** In case of the update_grain equal to 0, the film grain synthesis module should use the parameters
from the previous frame in the display order and not the coding order.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**apply_grain** equal to 1 specifies that film grain should be added to this frame.
apply_grain equal to 0 specifies that film grain should not be added.

**reset_grain_params( )** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements read in film_grain_params should be set equal to 0.

**grain_seed** specifies the starting value for the pseudo-random numbers used during film grain synthesis.

**film_grain_param_set_idx** is an index of a film grain parameter set. Up to 8 separate film grain parameter
sets may be simultaneously stored by the film grain processing module.

**Note:** An encoder may use film_grain_param_set_idx to differentiate between up to 8 separate film grain models.
For example, in the case of varying output frame resolutions, an encoder may assign different film_grain_param_set_idx to
film grain parameters that are used with frames with different output resolutions.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**update_grain** equal to 1 means that a new set of parameters is sent.
update_grain equal to 0 means that the previous set of parameters in the frame display order should be used.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that for every distinct value of film_grain_param_set_idx used in a coded video
sequence, the first frame in the display order with that value of film_grain_param_set_idx that has apply_grain flag equal to 1
have update_grain equal to 1.

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain parameters associated with a particular film_grain_param_set_idx value can only
be infered from previously signaled parameters in the display order with the same value of film_grain_param_set_idx
in the current coded video sequence.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**load_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements
in av1_film_grain_params should be set equal to the values stored in an area of memory used by the idx.

**tempGrainSeed** is a temporary variable that is used to avoid losing the value of grain_seed when load_grain_params is called.
When update_grain is equal to 0, a previous set of parameters should be used for everything except grain_seed.

**apply_units_resolution_log2** indicates the units used for indicating apply_horz_resolution and apply_vert_resolution.

**apply_vert_resolution** indicates the luma vertical resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

**apply_horz_resolution** indicates the luma horizontal resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

[Ed.note. It is intended to recommend for the encoders to put the FGS parameters corresponding to the decoded picture resolution into the metadata.]

{:.alert .alert-info }

**video_frame_characteristics_flag** equal to 1 indicates that the syntax elements bit_depth, mono_chrome, subsampling_x, subsampling_y are signaled in this metadata message.
video_frame_characteristics_flag equal to 0 indicates that the syntax elements bit_depth, mono_chrome, subsampling_x, subsampling_y are not signal in this metadata message.
If video_frame_characteristics_flag equal to 0, variables BitDepth, mono_chrome, SubX, and SubY are derived from the decoded video frame, to which this metadata message
belongs. 

**bit_depth** is a syntax element which determines bit depth of the decoded video sequence or a decoded video frame, to which this metadata belongs to.

**mono_chrome** equal to 1 indicates that the video does not contain U and V color planes. mono_chrome equal to 0 indicates that the video contains Y, U, and V color planes.

**subsampling_x**, **subsampling_y** specify the chroma subsampling format:

| subsampling_x | subsampling_y | mono_chrome | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | -----------
| 0             | 0             | 0           | YUV 4:4:4
| 1             | 0             | 0           | YUV 4:2:2
| 1             | 1             | 0           | YUV 4:2:0
| 1             | 1             | 1           | Monochrome 4:0:0

In case of 12 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 16.)
