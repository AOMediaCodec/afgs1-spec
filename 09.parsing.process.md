## Parsing process


### Parsing process for f(n)

This process is invoked when the descriptor of a syntax element in the syntax
tables is equal to f(n).

The next n bits are read from the bit stream.

This process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
x = 0
for ( i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
    x = 2 * x + read_bit( )
}
~~~~~

read_bit( ) reads the next bit from the bitstream and advances the bitstream
position indicator by 1. If the bitstream is provided as a series of bytes, then the
first bit is given by the most significant bit of the first byte.

The value for the syntax element is given by x.
