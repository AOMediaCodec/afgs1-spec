## Scope

This document provides the metadata format and bit-accurate specification for 
the standalone AOMedia film grain synthesis technology. This technology is based on the film grain modeling process that is currently specified in the AV1 specification. However, it permits the same model to be applied on other video coding specifications that may support ITU-T T.35 signaling.
