## Syntax structures semantics

### General

This section specifies the meaning of the syntax elements read in the syntax
structures.

Important variables and function calls are also described.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 metadata semantics

**itu_t_t35_country_code** is a syntax element that corresponds to the syntax element itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code in an ITU-T T.35 user registered metadata syntax. Its value, for the indication of the AOMedia Film Grain Synthesis metadata, as specified according to this specification, shall be equal to 0xB5, which indicates that the
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code is registered in the United States.

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code** are two bytes having values specified as a terminal
provider code in
[reference name required](https://cdn.cta.tech/cta/media/media/resources/standards/pdfs/manucode_2020-2.pdf).
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code equal to 0x5890 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload is
specified by AOMedia.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 payload semantics

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code** provides the value of the
ITU-T T.35 terminal provider oriented code that is defined
in the [AOMedia metadata registry](https://aomediacodec.github.io/metadata-registry/) specification.
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code equal to 0x0001 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload
contains AOMedia film grain parameters, as defined by this specification.

### Film grain parameter sets semantics
[AMT: I assume this is correctly updated according to syntax in another request]

**afgs_enable_flag** equal to 1 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is applied to the decoded frame
associated with the current message.  afgs_enable_flag equal to 0 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is not 
applied to the decoded frame associated with the current message.

**num_film_grain_sets_minus1** plus 1 specifies the number of signaled film grain parameter sets.

**select_film_grain_param_set()** is a function call that returns the index of the film grain parameter
set signaled in the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function that is most appropriate for the current
decoder configuration.

**Note:** It is recommended that the most appropriate film grain parameter set is the film grain
parameter set having the largest spatial resolution that is both supported by the film grain synthesis
process of the decoder and is less than or equal to the intended reconstructed, e.g. display, resolution.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**load_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that specifies that all syntax elements determined in the 
av1_film_grain_parmas function and all variables beginning with upper case determined in the av1_film_grain_params
function shall be set equal to the values located in the memory location denoted by index idx.

#### Conformance

Conformance to this specification requires that all requirements specified in this section be fulfilled.

For a given decoded picture, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set for a given
combination of luma horizontal and luma vertical resolution.

For a given decoded picture, if film grain parameter sets are associated with this picture, one film grain parameter 
set shall be provided satisfying the following conditions: (i) apply_horz_resolution equal to the luma horizontal 
resolution of the decoded frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2, (ii) apply_vert_resolution equal to the luma vertical 
resolution of the decoded frame >> apply_units_resolution_log2, (iii) subsampling_x equal to the chroma horizontal 
subsampling of the decoded frame, (iv) subsampling_y equal to the chroma vertical subsampling of the decoded frame, 
and (v) bitdepth equal to the bitdepth of the decoded frame when the bitdepth syntax element is present.

For a given decoded picture, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set
with the same film_grain_param_set_idx value.

For a given decoded picture, all film grain parameter sets associated with the picture shall
have the same value for afgs1_enable_flag. 

**Note:** The conformance statements above mean that if film grain parameter sets are associated with
a decoded picture, there must be one film grain parameter set that corresponds to the
decoded picture resolution, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set that
corresponds to the same resolution, and that film grain parameter sets related to the same
decoded picture shall each use a unique value of film_grain_param_set_idx.

### Film grain parameters semantics

This metadata provides the post-processing module with a model for parameterized film grain
synthesis. The film grain process is applied to frames output by a video decoder or
a video post-processing module. A picture can be either a frame or a field. The film 
grain synthesis should be applied at the resolution specified for the selected film grain parameter set.

**Note:** An encoder may use this film grain metadata to characterize film grain that was present in the
original source video material and could have been removed by pre-processing filtering techniques or by the encoding process. The specified
film grain parameters and the post-processing algorithm are equivalent to the AV1 film grain synthesis
at the picture level.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The film grain parameters signaled in this metadata message are applied to the output video picture that
is associated with the coded video picture that follows or precedes the current metadata message in the
encoded video bitstream. 
[AMT: precedes was added since specs like HEVC allow T.35 messages to be indicated as both prefix and suffix SEI messages]

**Note:** When coding the film grain parameters in this metadata message, the encoder should consider the 
scalability layer structure of the bitstream. In particular, the metadata assosiated with lower scalability layers
should not refer to the film grain parameters associated with higher scalability layers.
{:.alert .alert-info }
[ AMT: Is this note needed? Should this not be a decision of the system that uses such metadata?]

**Note:** In the case of update_grain equal to 0, the film grain synthesis module should use the parameters
from the previous picture in the display order and not the coding order.
{:.alert .alert-info }
[AMT: This seems incorrect since it sounds as if we have some form of display persistence. This is also talking about some encoding process, which seems odd. I would suggest removing this note]

**film_grain_param_set_idx** is an index of a film grain parameter set. Up to 8 separate film grain parameter
sets may be simultaneously stored by the film grain processing module.

**Note:** An encoder may use film_grain_param_set_idx to differentiate between up to 8 separate film grain models.
For example, in the case of varying output picture resolutions, an encoder may assign different film_grain_param_set_idx to
film grain parameters that are used with frames with different output resolutions.
{:.alert .alert-info }
[ AMT: Why only 8?]

**apply_grain** equal to 1 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is disabled when the film grain parameters 
determined in the current av1_film_grain_params function are selected.  apply_grain equal to 0 specifies that the 
film grain syntehsis process is enabled when the film grain parameters are selected.

**save_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that specifies that all syntax elements determined in the 
av1_film_grain_params_function and all variables beginning with upper case determined in the 
av1_film_grain_params_function shall be stored in the memory location denoted by idx.
[AMT]: # (Better if such processes are clearly specified)

**grain_seed** specifies the starting value for the pseudo-random numbers used during film grain synthesis.

**update_grain** equal to 1 means that a new set of parameters is sent.
update_grain equal to 0 means that the previous set of parameters in the picture display order should be used.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that for every distinct value of film_grain_param_set_idx used in a coded video
sequence, the first picture in display order with that value of film_grain_param_set_idx that has the apply_grain flag equal to 1
has update_grain equal to 1.

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain parameters associated with a particular film_grain_param_set_idx value can only
be infered from previously signaled parameters in display order with the same value of film_grain_param_set_idx
in the current coded video sequence.
{:.alert .alert-info }

[AMT: Isn't our specification dealing with parameters only in coding order? ]

**tempGrainSeed** is a temporary variable that is used to avoid losing the value of grain_seed when load_grain_params is called.
When update_grain is equal to 0, a previous set of parameters should be used for everything except grain_seed.

**apply_units_resolution_log2** indicates the units used for indicating apply_horz_resolution and apply_vert_resolution.

**apply_vert_resolution** indicates the luma vertical resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

**apply_horz_resolution** indicates the luma horizontal resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

[Ed.note. It is intended to recommend for the encoders to put the FGS parameters corresponding to the decoded picture resolution into the metadata.]
{:.alert .alert-info }

**luma_only** equal to 1 specifies that the film grain synthesis parameters do not include U and V color planes.  luma_only
equal to 0 specifies that the film grain synthesis parameters do include U and V color planes.

**subsampling_x** equal to 0 specifies that the horizontal resolution of the chroma component of the film grain 
synthesis parameters is the same as the horizontal resolution of the luma component.  subsampling_x equal to 1
specifies that the horizontal resolution of the chroma component of the film grain synthesis parameters is equal to
the horizontal resolution of the luma component subsampled by a factor of two.

**subsampling_y** equal to 0 specifies that the vertical resolution of the chroma component of the film grain
synthesis parameters is the same as the vertical resolution of the luma component.  subsampling_y equal to 1
specifies that the vertical resolution of the chroma component of the film grain synthesis parameters is equal to
the vertical resolution of the luma component subsampled by a factor of two.

**Note:** The table below shows example mappings between common image formats and values for the subsampling_x, subsampling_y,
and luma_only syntax elements.
{:.alert .alert-info }

| subsampling_x | subsampling_y | luma_only | Description

are not predicted from scaling functions that belong to other film grain parameters sets.
predict_scaling equal to 1 specifies that scaling functions in the current film grain parameter

        + (point_y_scaling_res[ i ] - ( 1 << (bits_per_y_scaling_res-1)  ) )* y_scaling_res_granularity )

for ( i = 0; i < numPosChroma; i++ )
    ar_coeffs_cr[ i ] = ar_coeffs_cr[ i ] - (1<<(BitsArCr - 1)).
~~~~~

**ar_coeff_shift_minus_6** specifies the range of the auto-regressive coefficients. The values of 0, 1, 2, and 3
correspond to the ranges for auto-regressive coefficients of [-2, 2), [-1, 1), [-0.5, 0.5), and [-0.25, 0.25)
respectively.

**grain_scale_shift** specifies how much the Gaussian random numbers should be scaled down during
the grain synthesis process.

**cb_mult** represents a multiplier for the Cb component used in the derivation of the input
index to the Cb component scaling function.

**cb_luma_mult** represents a multiplier for the average luma component used in the
derivation of the input index to the Cb component scaling function.

**cb_offset** represents an offset used in the derivation of the input index to the Cb component
scaling function.

**cr_mult** represents a multiplier for the Cr component used in the derivation of the input index
to the Cr component scaling function.

**cr_luma_mult** represents a multiplier for the average luma component used in the
derivation of the input index to the Cr component scaling function.

**cr_offset** represents an offset used in the derivation of the input index to the Cr component
scaling function.

**overlap_flag** equal to 1 indicates that an overlap between film grain blocks should be
applied. overlap_flag equal to 0 indicates that the overlap between film grain blocks should
not be applied.

**clip_to_restricted_range** equal to 1 indicates that clipping to the restricted (studio)
range is applied to the sample values after adding the film grain (see the semantics for color_range for an explanation of studio swing).
clip_to_restricted_range equal to 0 indicates that clipping to the full range shall be
applied to the sample values after adding the film grain.
