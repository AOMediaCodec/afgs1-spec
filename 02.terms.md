## Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Bitstream

: The sequence of bits generated by encoding a sequence of frames.

Bit string

: An ordered string with a limited number of bits. The left most bit is the most
  significant bit (MSB) and the right most bit is the least significant bit (LSB).

Byte

: An 8-bit bit string.

Byte alignment

: One bit, byte, or syntax element is byte aligned if the position of the bit, byte, or syntax element, respectively in the bitstream is an integer multiple of
  eight from the position of the first bit in the bitstream.

Chroma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value of one of the two color
  difference signals.

  **Note:** Symbols of chroma are U and V.

Coded frame

: The representation of one frame before the decoding process.

Coded video sequence

: A coded video sequence is a sequence of access units or temporal units that
consists of a random access point, which is followed by zero or more access
units or temporal units up to but not including the subsequent random access
point.

Component

: One of the three sample value matrices (one luma matrix and two chroma
  matrices) or its single sample value.

Decoded frame

: The frame reconstructed out of the bitstream by the decoder.

Decoder

: One embodiment of the decoding process.

[AMT]: # (In this spec, should we be talking about an encoding and decoding process? Or is the encoding/decoding about the video data, the film grain parameters, or both? It seems to me that we may need to even define "synthesis" and grain adition here instead of talking about decoding )

Decoding process

: The process that derives decoded frames from syntax elements, including any processing 
  steps used prior to and for the film grain synthesis process.

[AMT]: # (See my above comments. We should define a film grain parameter decoding process and film grain synthesis and addition processes, and not talk about decoding here. Right? Same for Encoder and Decoder. The definition above seems incorrect in any case given the scope of this document. Maybe as a suggestion, the decoding process here should be about "the process that derives the film grain synthesis parameters from syntax elements", instead of what is defined above)

Encoder

: One embodiment of the encoding process.

Encoding process

: A process not specified in this Specification that generates the bitstream
  that conforms to the description provided in this document.

  [AMT]: # (This encoding process is only for the film grain parameters)

Flag

: A binary variable - some variables and syntax elements (e.g.
  luma_only_grain) are described using the word flag to highlight that the
  syntax element can only be equal to 0 or equal to 1.

Frame

: The representation of video signals in the spatial domain, composed of one
  luma sample matrix (Y) and two chroma sample matrices (U and V).

Key frame

: An Intra frame which resets the decoding process when it is shown.

Level

: A defined set of constraints on the values for the syntax elements and
  variables.

Luma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value representing the monochrome
  signal related to the primary colors.

  **Note:** The symbol representing luma is Y.

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.


Profile

: A subset of syntax, semantics and algorithms defined in a part.

Raster scan

: Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in
  which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the
  two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and
  the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.

Random Access Point (RAP)

: A frame, ar which a decoder may start decoding a coded video sequence.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding
  prediction values.

  [AMT]: # (I would assume that here we reconstruct noise and we add it on the images. There is no residual. Correct? We likely need to redefine this term for this document assuming it is needed. Same for other terms in this document, such as "reference")
  
Reference

: One of a set of tags, each of which is mapped to a reference frame.

Reserved

: A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the
  future.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the frame.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive) for 8-bit
  frames, from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) for 10-bit frames, and from 0 to 4095
  (inclusive) for 12-bit frames.

   [AMT]: # (This should not be restricted to the bitdepths supported in AV1. Other video technologies may support other bitdepths and this should be generic. Q: Do we have the flexibility to indicate different bitdepths in this spec? If not, should we have?)

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or
  several consecutive coded frames.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.

Temporal group

: A set of frames whose temporal prediction structure is used periodically in a
  video sequence.

Tier

: A specified category of level constraints imposed on the values of the syntax elements
  in the bitstream.
