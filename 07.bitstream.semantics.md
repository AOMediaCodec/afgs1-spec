### General

This section specifies the meaning of the syntax elements present in the syntax
structures.

Important variables and function calls are also described.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 metadata semantics

**itu_t_t35_country_code** is a syntax element that corresponds to the country code
in an ITU-T T.35 user registered metadata syntax.  itu_t_t35_country_code shall be equal
to 0xB5 for bitstreams conforming to this version of the specification.

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code** is a syntax element that corresponds to a terminal
provider code in an ITU-T T.35 user registered metadata syntax.  itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code 
shall be equal to 0x5890 for bitstreams conforming to this version of the  specification.

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code** shall be equal to 0x01 for bitstreams 
conforming to this version of the specification.

### Film grain parameter sets semantics

**afgs_enable_flag** equal to 1 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is applied to the decoded picture
associated with the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function.  afgs_enable_flag equal to 0 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is not 
applied to the decoded picture associated with the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function.

**reserved_4bits** must be set to 0.  The value is ignored by a decoder. 

**num_film_grain_sets_minus1** plus 1 specifies the number of signaled film grain parameter sets in the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function.

**select_film_grain_param_set()** is a function call that returns the index of the film grain parameter
set signaled in the current av1_film_grain_param_sets function that is most appropriate for the current
decoder configuration.

**Note:** It is recommended that the most appropriate film grain parameter set is the film grain
parameter set having the largest spatial resolution that is both supported by the film grain synthesis
process of the decoder and is less than or equal to the intended display resolution.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**load_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that specifies that all syntax elements determined in the 
av1_film_grain_params function and all variables beginning with upper case determined in the av1_film_grain_params
function shall be set equal to the values located in the memory location denoted by idx.

#### Conformance

Conformance to this specification requires that all requirements specified in this section be fulfilled.

For a given decoded picture, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set for a given
combination of luma horizontal and luma vertical resolution.

For a given decoded picture, if film grain parameter sets are associated with this picture, one film grain parameter 
set shall be provided satisfying the following conditions: (i) apply_horz_resolution equal to the luma horizontal 
resolution of the decoded picture >> apply_units_resolution_log2, (ii) apply_vert_resolution equal to the luma vertical

with the same film_grain_param_set_idx value.

For a given decoded picture, all film grain parameter sets associated with the picture shall
have the same value for afgs1_enable_flag. 

**Note:** The conformance statements above mean that if film grain parameter sets are associated with
a decoded picture, there must be one film grain parameter set that corresponds to the
decoded picture resolution, there shall not be more than one film grain parameter set that
correspond to the same resolution, and film grain parameter sets related to the same
decoded picture shall each use a unique of film_grain_param_set_idx.

### Film grain parameter payload semantics
**payload_less_than_4byte_flag** equal to 1 specifies that the number of bytes used by the data in the current
av1_film_grain_payload is less than four bytes.  payload_less_than_4byte_flag equal to 0 specifies that the number of
bytes used by the data in the current av1_film_grain_payload may be equal to four or more bytes.

(and any sub-functions), as well as optional zero padding bytes.  The zero padding
bytes can be useful for applications that choose to create an av1_film_grain_payload prior to determining the 
payload contents.

### Film grain parameters semantics

This metadata provides the post-processing module with a model for parameterized film grain
synthesis. The film grain process is applied to pictures output by a video decoder or
a video post-processing module. The film grain synthesis should be applied at the resolution 
specified for the selected film grain parameter set.

**Note:** An encoder may use this film grain metadata to characterize film grain that was present in the
original source video material and was removed by pre-processing filtering techniques. The specified
film grain parameters and the post-processing algorithm are equivalent to the AV1 film grain synthesis
at the picture level.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The film grain parameters signaled in this metadata message are applied to the output video picture that
is associated with the coded video picture that follows the current metadata message in the
encoded video bitstream. 

**Note:** When coding the film grain parameters in this metadata message, the encoder should consider the 
scalability layering structure of the bitstream. In particular, the metadata assosiated with lower scalability layers
should not refer to the film grain parameters associated with higher scalability layers.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**film_grain_param_set_idx** specifies the index of a film grain parameter set. Up to 8 separate film grain parameter
sets can be simultaneously stored by the film grain processing module.

**Note:** An encoder may use film_grain_param_set_idx to differentiate between up to 8 separate film grain models.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**apply_grain_flag** equal to 1 specifies that the film grain synthesis process is disabled when the film grain parameters 
determined in the current av1_film_grain_params function are selected.  apply_grain_flag equal to 0 specifies that the 
film grain synthesis process is enabled when the film grain parameters are selected.

**save_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that specifies that all syntax elements determined in the 
av1_film_grain_params function and all variables beginning with upper case determined in the 
av1_film_grain_params function shall be stored in the memory location denoted by idx.


**grain_seed** specifies the starting value for the pseudo-random numbers used during film grain synthesis.

**update_grain_flag** equal to 1 specifies the presence of a new set of film grain parameters. update_grain_flag equal to 0 
specifies that a set of film grain parameters corresponding to the film_grain_param_set_idx value should be used.

It is a requirement of the specification conformance that for every distinct value of film_grain_param_set_idx used in a coded video
sequence, the first frame in the decoding order with that value of film_grain_param_set_idx that has apply_grain_flag flag equal to 1
have update_grain_flag equal to 1.

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain parameters associated with a particular film_grain_param_set_idx value can only
be inferred from previously signaled parameters in the frame decoding order with the same value of film_grain_param_set_idx
in the current coded video sequence.
{:.alert .alert-info }

It is a requirement of the specification conformance that if (i) update_grain_flag is equal to zero, (ii) apply_horz_resolution equal to 
the luma horizontal resolution of the decoded frame » apply_units_resolution_log2, and (iii) apply_vert_resolution equal to the luma 
vertical resolution of the decoded frame » apply_units_resolution_log2 then the film_grain_param_set_idx shall reference the 
film grain parameters set that when the save_grain_params( film_grain_param_set_idx ) function was called, the following conditions were true
(i) update_grain_flag was equal to 1, (ii) apply_horz_resolution was equal to 
the luma horizontal resolution of the decoded frame » apply_units_resolution_log2, and (iii) apply_vert_resolution was equal to the luma 
vertical resolution of the decoded frame » apply_units_resolution_log2. 

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain parameters associated with the decoded picture resolution can only
be inferred from previously signaled parameters that corresponded to the decoded picture resolution. This requirement is 
intended to make sure that bitstreams that exercise variable decoded picture resolution do not copy the film grain parameters
for the decoded picture resolutions from frames that were not at a decoded picture resolutions. This requirements helps
decoders that only use (and store) film grain parameter sets that correspond to the decoded picture resolution.
{:.alert .alert-info }

synthesis parameters in the current set is the same as the vertical resolution of the luma component.  subsampling_y equal to 1

the vertical resolution of the luma component subsampled by a factor of two.

and luma_only_flag syntax elements.

It is a requirement of conformance to this specification that when film_grain_param_set_idx_for_prediction is present, it shall be 
equal to the value of film_grain_param_set_idx that is determined in the first call to av1_film_grain_params( ) 
within the current aom_itu_t_t35_payload( ).

**Note:** This requirement restricts prediction between the film grain parameter sets to be within one 
aom_itu_t_t35_payload( ).  It also restricts the reference for the prediction process to be the film grain parameter set 
determined in the first av1_film_grain_params( ) call.

**num_cr_points** specifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the Cr component.

It is a requirement of conformance to this specification that num_cr_points is less than or equal to 10.

If SubX is equal to 1 and SubY is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is equal to 0,
it is a requirement of conformance to this specification that num_cr_points is equal to 0.

If SubX is equal to 1 and SubY is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is not equal to 0,
it is a requirement of conformance to this specification that num_cr_points is not equal to 0.

**Note:** These requirements ensure that for 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, film grain noise will be applied to both chroma components, or to neither.
There is no restriction for 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.
