## Scope

This document provides the metadata format and a bit-accurate specification for 
the standalone AOMedia film grain synthesis technology. This technology is equivalent at the frame level
to the film grain technology described in the AV1 specification, but can be utilized with other video compression systems. 
The corresponding metadata can be signaled using ITU-T T.35 registered user metadata format.
