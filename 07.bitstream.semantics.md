## Syntax structures semantics

### General

This section specifies the meaning of the syntax elements read in the syntax
structures.

Important variables and function calls are also described.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 metadata semantics

**itu_t_t35_country_code** shall be a byte having a value specified as a country code by Annex A
of Recommendation ITU-T T.35. itu_t_t35_country_code equal to 0xB5 indicates that the
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code is registered in the United States.

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code** are two bytes having values specified as a terminal
provider code in
[reference name required](https://cdn.cta.tech/cta/media/media/resources/standards/pdfs/manucode_2020-2.pdf).
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code equal to 0x5890 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload is
specified by AOMedia.

### AOMedia ITU-T T.35 payload semantics

**itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code** provides the value of the
ITU-T T3.5 terminal provider oriented code that is defined
in the [AOMedia metadata registry](https://aomediacodec.github.io/metadata-registry/) specification.
itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code equal to 0x0001 indicates that the ITU-T T.35 payload
contains AV1 film grain parameters, as defined by this specification.

### Film grain parameters semantics

This metadata provides the post-processing module with a model for parameterized film grain
synthesis. The film grain process is applied to frames output by a video decoder or
a video post-processing module. The film grain synthesis shall be applied at the decoder output resolution.

**Note:** An encoder may use this film grain metadata to characterize film grain that was present in the
original source video material and was removed by pre-processing filtering techniques. The specified
film grain parameters and the post-processing algorithm are equivalent to the AV1 film grain synthesis
at the frame level.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The film grain parameters signaled in this metadata message are applied to the output video frame that
is associated with the coded video frame that follows the current metadata message in the
encoded video bitstream. The film grain processing is applied to the output video frames in the display order.
Even though the film grain metadata is associated with a particular picture in the coded frame order,
the persistence of the film grain parameters shall be considered in the display order.

**Note:** In case of the update_grain equal to 0, the film grain synthesis module should use the parameters
from the previous frame in the display order and not the coding order.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**apply_grain** equal to 1 specifies that film grain should be added to this frame.
apply_grain equal to 0 specifies that film grain should not be added.

**reset_grain_params( )** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements read in film_grain_params should be set equal to 0.

**grain_seed** specifies the starting value for the pseudo-random numbers used during film grain synthesis.

**film_grain_param_set_idx** is an index of a film grain parameter set. Up to 8 separate film grain parameter
sets may be simultaneously stored by the film grain processing module.

**Note:** An encoder may use film_grain_param_set_idx to differentiate between up to 8 separate film grain models.
For example, in the case of varying output frame resolutions, an encoder may assign different film_grain_param_set_idx to
film grain parameters that are used with frames with different output resolutions.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**update_grain** equal to 1 means that a new set of parameters is sent.
update_grain equal to 0 means that the previous set of parameters in the frame display order should be used.

It is a requirement of the bitstream conformance that for every distinct value of film_grain_param_set_idx used in a coded video
sequence, the first frame in the display order with that value of film_grain_param_set_idx that has apply_grain flag equal to 1
have update_grain equal to 1.

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain parameters associated with a particular film_grain_param_set_idx value can only
be infered from previously signaled parameters in the display order with the same value of film_grain_param_set_idx
in the current coded video sequence.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**load_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements
in av1_film_grain_params should be set equal to the values stored in an area of memory used by the idx.

**tempGrainSeed** is a temporary variable that is used to avoid losing the value of grain_seed when load_grain_params is called.
When update_grain is equal to 0, a previous set of parameters should be used for everything except grain_seed.

**apply_units_resolution_log2** indicates the units used for indicating apply_horz_resolution and apply_vert_resolution.

**apply_vert_resolution** indicates the luma vertical resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

**apply_horz_resolution** indicates the luma horizontal resolution corresponding to the film grain synthesis parameters in units of 1 << apply_units_resolution_log2 luma samples.

[Ed.note. It is intended to recommend for the encoders to put the FGS parameters corresponding to the decoded picture resolution into the metadata.]

{:.alert .alert-info }

**bit_depth** is syntax elements which determines bit depth of the decoded video sequence or a decoded video frame, to which this metadata belongs to.

**mono_chrome** equal to 1 indicates that the video does not contain U and V color planes. mono_chrome equal to 0 indicates that the video contains Y, U, and V color planes.

**subsampling_x**, **subsampling_y** specify the chroma subsampling format:

| subsampling_x | subsampling_y | mono_chrome | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | -----------
| 0             | 0             | 0           | YUV 4:4:4
| 1             | 0             | 0           | YUV 4:2:2
| 1             | 1             | 0           | YUV 4:2:0
| 1             | 1             | 1           | Monochrome 4:0:0
{:.table .table-sm .table-bordered }

**num_y_points** specifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the luma component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_y_points is less than or equal to 14.

**point_y_value[ i ]** represents the x (luma value) coordinate for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for luma component. The values are signaled on the scale of
0..255. (In case of 10 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 4.
In case of 12 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 16.)

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_y_value[ i ] is greater than point_y_value[ i - 1 ]
(this ensures the x coordinates are specified in increasing order).

**point_y_scaling[ i ]** represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for luma component.

**luma_only_grain** equal to 1 indicates that the film grain synthesis process is only applied to the luma component.
luma_only_grain equal to 0 indicates that the film grain synthesis process can be applied to the chroma components.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that when the reconstructed video is monochrome, luma_only_grain is equal to 1.

**chroma_scaling_from_luma** equal to 1 specifies that the chroma scaling is inferred from the luma scaling.
chroma_scaling_from_luma equal to 0 specifies that the chroma scaling is signaled independently.

**num_cb_points** specifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the cb component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cb_points is less than or equal to 10.

**Note:** When chroma_scaling_from_luma is equal to 1, it is still allowed for num_y_points to take values up to 14.
This means that the chroma scaling also needs to support up to 14 points.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**point_cb_value[ i ]**  represents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear
scaling function for cb component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255.

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cb_value[ i ] is greater than point_cb_value[ i - 1 ].

**point_cb_scaling[ i ]**  represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for cb component.

**num_cr_points** specifies  represents the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the cr component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is less than or equal to 10.

If subX is equal to 1 and subY is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is equal to 0,
it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is equal to 0.

If subX is equal to 1 and subY is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is not equal to 0,
it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is not equal to 0.

**Note:** These requirements ensure that for 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, film grain noise will be applied to both chroma components, or to neither.
There is no restriction for 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**point_cr_value[ i ]**  represents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear
scaling function for cr component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255.

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cr_value[ i ] is greater than point_cr_value[ i - 1 ].

**point_cr_scaling[ i ]** represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for cr component.

**grain_scaling_minus_8** represents the shift â€“ 8 applied to the values of the chroma
component. The grain_scaling_minus_8 can take values of 0..3 and determines the
range and quantization step of the standard deviation of film grain.

**ar_coeff_lag** specifies the number of auto-regressive coefficients for
luma and chroma.

**ar_coeffs_y_plus_128[ i ]** specifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the Y plane.

**ar_coeffs_cb_plus_128[ i ]** specifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the U plane.

correspond to the ranges for auto-regressive coefficients of [-2, 2), [-1, 1), [-0.5, 0.5) and [-0.25, 0.25)
respectively.

**grain_scale_shift** specifies how much the Gaussian random numbers should be scaled down during
the grain synthesis process.

applied. overlap_flag equal to 0 indicates that the overlap between film grain blocks shall
not be applied.

**clip_to_restricted_range** equal to 1 indicates that clipping to the restricted (studio)
range shall be applied to the sample values after adding the film grain (see the semantics for color_range for an explanation of studio swing).
clip_to_restricted_range equal to 0 indicates that clipping to the full range shall be
applied to the sample values after adding the film grain.

**save_grain_params( idx )** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements
in the area of memory used by the idx should be set equal to the values read in av1_film_grain_params.
