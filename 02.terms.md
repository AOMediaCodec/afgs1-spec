## Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Bitstream

: The sequence of bits representing film grain synthesis parameters that complements the decoded video picture sequence.

Bit string

: An ordered string with a limited number of bits. The left most bit is the most significant bit (MSB) and the right most bit is the least significant bit (LSB).

Byte

: An 8-bit bit string.

Chroma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value of one of the two color difference signals.

  **Note:** Symbols of chroma are U and V.

Coded picture

: The representation of one picture before the decoding process.

Coded video sequence

: A coded video sequence is a sequence of access units or temporal units that consists of a random access point, which is followed by zero or more access units or temporal units up to but not including the subsequent random access point.

Component

: One of the three sample value matrices (one luma matrix and two chroma matrices) or its single sample value.

Decoded picture

: The picture reconstructed out of the bitstream by the decoder.

Video decoder

: One embodiment of the video decoding process.

Video decoding process

: The process that derives decoded pictures from syntax elements, including all steps from interpreting the syntax elements to producing the final decoded video pictures.

Film grain synthesis process

: The process that derives film grain parameters from syntax elements, including any processing steps used for the film grain synthesis process.

Film grain synthesis module

: One embodiment of the film grain synthesis process.

Film grain analysis process

: A process not specified in this specification that generates film grain parameters that conforms to the description provided in this document.

Film grain analyzer

: One embodiment of the film grain analysis process.

Flag

: A binary variable - some variables and syntax elements (e.g. video_signal_characteristics_flag) are described using the word flag to highlight that the syntax element can only be equal to 0 or equal to 1.

Field

: A collection of samples from alternative rows of a frame.

Frame

: A composition of samples that constitute an entire image and includes samples from a top and a bottom field, where the top and bottom fields correspond to samples from even and odd numbered rows respectively. A frame may be composed of one luma sample matrix (Y) and optionally two chroma sample matrices (U and V).

Picture

: The representation of video signals in the spatial domain, composed of one luma sample matrix (Y) and, optionally, two chroma sample matrices (U and V) in a 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4, 4:0:0 color format. The picture could be either a frame or a field.

Luma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value representing the monochrome signal related to the primary colors.

  **Note:** The symbol representing luma is Y.

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.

Random Access Point (RAP)

: A picture at which a decoder may start decoding a coded video sequence.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding prediction values.

  [AMT]: # (I would assume that here we reconstruct noise and we add it on the images. There is no residual. Correct? We likely need to redefine this term for this document assuming it is needed. Same for other terms in this document, such as "reference")
[ToDo] Clean-up the reconstruction usage in this specification.
  
Reference

: One of a set of tags, each of which is mapped to a reference picture.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the picture.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an number in the range from the minimum sample value to the maximum sample value.

[ToDo] Check if the reference synthesis process supports the bit depths outside of the 8 to 12 bit range.

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or several consecutive coded pictures.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.
