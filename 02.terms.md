## Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Base layer

: The layer with spatial_id and temporal_id values equal to 0.

Bitstream

: The sequence of bits generated by encoding a sequence of frames.

Bit string

: An ordered string with limited number of bits. The left most bit is the most
  significant bit (MSB), the right most bit is the least significant bit (LSB).

Byte

: An 8-bit bit string.

Byte alignment

: One bit is byte aligned if the position of the bit is an integer multiple of
  eight from the position of the first bit in the bitstream.

Chroma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value of one of the two color
  difference signals.

  **Note:** Symbols of chroma are U and V.

Coded frame

: The representation of one frame before the decoding process.

Component

: One of the three sample value matrices (one luma matrix and two chroma
  matrices) or its single sample value.

Decoded frame

: The frame reconstructed out of the bitstream by the decoder.

Decoder

: One embodiment of the decoding process.

Decoding process

: The process that derives decoded frames from syntax elements, including any processing 
  steps used prior to and for the film grain synthesis process.

Encoder

: One embodiment of the encoding process.

Encoding process

: A process not specified in this Specification that generates the bitstream
  that conforms to the description provided in this document.

Enhancement layer

: A layer with either spatial_id greater than 0 or temporal_id greater than 0.

Flag

: A binary variable - some variables and syntax elements (e.g.
  obu_extension_flag) are described using the word flag to highlight that the
  syntax element can only be equal to 0 or equal to 1.

Frame

: The representation of video signals in the spatial domain, composed of one
  luma sample matrix (Y) and two chroma sample matrices (U and V).

Key frame

: An Intra frame which resets the decoding process when it is shown.

Layer

: A set of tile group OBUs with identical spatial_id and identical temporal_id
  values.

Level

: A defined set of constraints on the values for the syntax elements and
  variables.

Luma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value representing the monochrome
  signal related to the primary colors.

  **Note:** The symbol representing luma is Y.

OBU

: All structures are packetized in "Open Bitstream Units" or OBUs. Each OBU has
  a header, which provides identifying information for the contained data
  (payload).

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.


Profile

: A subset of syntax, semantics and algorithms defined in a part.

Raster scan

: Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in
  which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the
  two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and
  the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding
  prediction values.
  
Reference

: One of a set of tags, each of which is mapped to a reference frame.

Reserved

: A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the
  future.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the frame.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive) for 8-bit
  frames, from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) for 10-bit frames, and from 0 to 4095
  (inclusive) for 12-bit frames.

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or
  several consecutive coded frames.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.

Temporal group

: A set of frames whose temporal prediction structure is used periodically in a
  video sequence.

Tier

: A specified category of level constraints imposed on the values of the syntax elements
  in the bitstream.
