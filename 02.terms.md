## Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Bitstream

: The sequence of bits generated by encoding a sequence of frames.

Bit string

: An ordered string with a limited number of bits. The left most bit is the most
  significant bit (MSB) and the right most bit is the least significant bit (LSB).

Byte

: An 8-bit bit string.

Byte alignment

: One bit, byte, or syntax element is byte aligned if the position of the bit, byte, or syntax element, respectively in the bitstream is an integer multiple of
  eight from the position of the first bit in the bitstream.

Chroma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value of one of the two color
  difference signals.

  **Note:** Symbols of chroma are U and V.

Coded frame

: The representation of one frame before the decoding process.

Coded video sequence

: A coded video sequence is a sequence of access units or temporal units that
consists of a random access point, which is followed by zero or more access
units or temporal units up to but not including the subsequent random access
point.

Component

: One of the three sample value matrices (one luma matrix and two chroma
  matrices) or its single sample value.

Decoded frame

: The frame reconstructed out of the bitstream by the video decoder.

Video decoder

: One embodiment of the video decoding process.

Video decoding process

: The process that derives decoded frames from syntax elements, including any processing 
  steps used prior to and generating decoded video frames.

Video encoding process

: A process not specified in this Specification that generates a video bitstream.

Film grain synthesis process

: The process that derives film grain parameters from syntax elements, including any processing 
  steps used  for the film grain synthesis process.

Film grain synthesis module

: One embodiment of the film grain synthesis process.

Film grain analyzer

: One embodiment of the film grain analysis process.

Film grain analysis process

: A process not specified in this Specification that generates film grain parameters
  that conforms to the description provided in this document.

Flag

: A binary variable - some variables and syntax elements (e.g.
  video_frame_characteristic_flag) are described using the word flag to highlight that the
  syntax element can only be equal to 0 or equal to 1.

Frame

: The representation of video signals in the spatial domain, composed of one
  luma sample matrix (Y) and two chroma sample matrices (U and V).

Key frame

: An Intra frame which resets the decoding process when it is shown.

Luma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value representing the monochrome
  signal related to the primary colors.

  **Note:** The symbol representing luma is Y.

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.

Raster scan

: Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in
  which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the
  two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and
  the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.

Random Access Point (RAP)

: A frame, ar which a decoder may start decoding a coded video sequence.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding
  prediction values.

  [AMT]: # (I would assume that here we reconstruct noise and we add it on the images. There is no residual. Correct? We likely need to redefine this term for this document assuming it is needed. Same for other terms in this document, such as "reference")
[ToDo] Clean-up the reconstruction usage in this specification.
  
  
Reference

: One of a set of tags, each of which is mapped to a reference frame.

Reserved

: A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the
  future.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the frame.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an number in the range from the minimum sample value to the maximum sample value.

[ToDo] Check if the reference synthesis process supports the bit depths outside of the 8 to 12 bit range.

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or
  several consecutive coded frames.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.
