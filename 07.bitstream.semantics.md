## Syntax structures semantics

### General

This section specifies the meaning of the syntax elements read in the syntax
structures.

Important variables and function calls are also described.

### OBU semantics

#### Metadata ITUT T35 semantics

**itu_t_t35_country_code** shall be a byte having a value specified as a country code by Annex A
of Recommendation ITU-T T.35.

**itu_t_t35_country_code_extension_byte** shall be a byte having a value specified as a country
code by Annex B of Recommendation ITU-T T.35.

**itu_t_t35_payload_bytes** shall be bytes containing data registered as specified in
Recommendation ITU-T T.35.

The ITU-T T.35 terminal provider code and terminal provider oriented code shall be contained in
the first one or more bytes of the itu_t_t35_payload_bytes, in the format specified by the
Administration that issued the terminal provider code. Any remaining bytes in
itu_t_t35_payload_bytes data shall be data having syntax and semantics as specified by the
entity identified by the ITU-T T.35 country code and terminal provider code.


#### Film grain params semantics

**apply_grain** equal to 1 specifies that film grain should be added to this frame.
apply_grain equal to 0 specifies that film grain should not be added.

**reset_grain_params()** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements read in film_grain_params should be set equal to 0.

**grain_seed** specifies the starting value for the pseudo-random numbers used during film grain synthesis.

**update_grain** equal to 1 means that a new set of parameters should be sent.
update_grain equal to 0 means that the previous set of parameters should be used.

**film_grain_params_ref_idx** indicates which reference frame contains the film grain parameters to be used for this frame.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that film_grain_params_ref_idx is equal to ref_frame_idx[ j ]
for some value of j in the range 0 to REFS_PER_FRAME - 1.

**Note:** This requirement means that film grain can only be predicted from the frames that the current frame
is using as reference frames.

**load_grain_params(idx)** is a function call that indicates that all the syntax elements
read in film_grain_params should be set equal to the values stored in an area of memory indexed by idx.

**tempGrainSeed** is a temporary variable that is used to avoid losing the value of grain_seed when load_grain_params is called.
When update_grain is equal to 0, a previous set of parameters should be used for everything except grain_seed.

**num_y_points** specifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the luma component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_y_points is less than or equal to 14.

**point_y_value[ i ]**  represents the x (luma value) coordinate for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for luma component. The values are signaled on the scale of
0..255. (In case of 10 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 4.
In case of 12 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 16.)

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_y_value[ i ] is greater than point_y_value[ i - 1 ]
(this ensures the x coordinates are specified in increasing order).

**point_y_scaling[ i ]** represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for luma component.

**chroma_scaling_from_luma** specifies that the chroma scaling is inferred from the luma scaling.

**num_cb_points** specifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the cb component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cb_points is less than or equal to 10.

**Note:** When chroma_scaling_from_luma is equal to 1, it is still allowed for num_y_points to take values up to 14.
This means that the chroma scaling also needs to support up to 14 points.

**point_cb_value[ i ]**  represents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear
scaling function for cb component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255.

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cb_value[ i ] is greater than point_cb_value[ i - 1 ].

**point_cb_scaling[ i ]**  represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for cb component.

**num_cr_points** specifies  represents the number of points for the piece-wise linear
scaling function of the cr component.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is less than or equal to 10.

If subsampling_x is equal to 1 and subsampling_y is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is equal to 0,
it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is equal to 0.

If subsampling_x is equal to 1 and subsampling_y is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is not equal to 0,
it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is not equal to 0.

**Note:** These requirements ensure that for 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, film grain noise will be applied to both chroma components, or to neither.
There is no restriction for 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.

**point_cr_value[ i ]**  represents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear
scaling function for cr component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255.

If i is greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cr_value[ i ] is greater than point_cr_value[ i - 1 ].

**point_cr_scaling[ i ]** represents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the piecewise
linear scaling function for cr component.

**grain_scaling_minus_8** represents the shift â€“ 8 applied to the values of the chroma
component. The grain_scaling_minus_8 can take values of 0..3 and determines the
range and quantization step of the standard deviation of film grain.

**ar_coeff_lag** specifies the number of auto-regressive coefficients for
luma and chroma.

**ar_coeffs_y_plus_128[ i ]** specifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the Y plane.

**ar_coeffs_cb_plus_128[ i ]** specifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the U plane.

**ar_coeffs_cr_plus_128[ i ]** specifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the V plane.

**ar_coeff_shift_minus_6** specifies the range of the auto-regressive coefficients. Values of 0, 1, 2, and 3
correspond to the ranges for auto-regressive coefficients of [-2, 2), [-1, 1), [-0.5, 0.5) and [-0.25, 0.25)
respectively.

**grain_scale_shift** specifies how much the Gaussian random numbers should be scaled down during
the grain synthesis process.

**cb_mult** represents a multiplier for the cb component used in derivation of the input
index to the cb component scaling function.

**cb_luma_mult** represents a multiplier for the average luma component used in
derivation of the input index to the cb component scaling function.

**cb_offset** represents an offset used in derivation of the input index to the cb component
scaling function.

**cr_mult** represents a multiplier for the cr component used in derivation of the input index
to the cr component scaling function.

**cr_luma_mult** represents a multiplier for the average luma component used in
derivation of the input index to the cr component scaling function.

**cr_offset** represents an offset used in derivation of the input index to the cr component
scaling function.

**overlap_flag** equal to 1 indicates that the overlap between film grain blocks shall be
applied. overlap_flag equal to 0 indicates that the overlap between film grain blocks shall
not be applied.

**clip_to_restricted_range** equal to 1 indicates that clipping to the restricted (studio)
range shall be applied to the sample values after adding the film grain (see the semantics for color_range for an explanation of studio swing).
clip_to_restricted_range equal to 0 indicates that clipping to the full range shall be
applied to the sample values after adding the film grain.
