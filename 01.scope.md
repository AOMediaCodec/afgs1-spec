## Scope

This document specifies the syntax, semantics, and decoding process for the AOMedia Film Grain 
Synthesis process. The process can be used with any video coding or transport mechanism.  This includes
the use of ITU-T T.35 signaling, and this use is also specified in this document. Alternatively, the payload 
can be carried by other suitable transport mechanisms. 

This specification is based on the film grain modeling process that is specified 
in the AV1 specification. However, this AOMedia Film Grain 
Synthesis process specification allows sending more than one film grain parameter
set for a decoded picture. A decoder can apply the film grain synthesis process at a different
resolution than the decoded picture resolution if the parameters for such resolution 
are present in the bitstream. A film grain 
parameter set that corresponds to the decoded picture resolution has to be present, which
may be useful for certain AV1 film grain synthesis implementations.
